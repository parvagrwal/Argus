# Fraud Policy

Version 1.0. This is the policy your agent operates under. Action names and approval routes in your case files must use the exact identifiers below.

### 0. What the agent starts with

Every transaction carries a `risk_score` between 0 and 1 from the bank's detection model. The model is useful and imperfect: many high scores are legitimate, and some fraud scores low. A score is a reason to look, never a verdict. The only confirmed outcomes are in the closed cases.

### 1. Actions

| Action | What it does | Customer impact |
|---|---|---|
| `ALLOW_TRANSACTION` | Let the flagged transaction stand | None |
| `DECLINE_TRANSACTION` | Decline the flagged authorization only. Card stays active | Low |
| `MONITOR_CARD` | Card stays active; raise monitoring sensitivity for 72 hours | None |
| `MONITOR_CONNECTED_CARDS` | Put other cards linked to the same device profile, region cluster, or ring under monitoring | None |
| `WARN_CUSTOMER` | Send an informational message (e.g. a recurring charge reminder, a security tip) | None |
| `VERIFY_WITH_CUSTOMER` | Ask the cardholder whether they made the transaction. Card stays active pending reply | Low |
| `STEP_UP_AUTH` | Require a one-time passcode or app confirmation before further activity | Low |
| `BLOCK_CARD` | Block this card and reissue | High |
| `BLOCK_ALL_CARDS` | Block every card the customer holds | Very high |
| `GENERATE_REPORT` | Write up the investigation for the internal record, without opening a case | None |
| `CREATE_CASE` | Open an internal fraud case with the evidence attached, and write it to the graph. See 3a | None |
| `FILE_REPORT` | File a suspicious activity report with the regulator. See 3a | None |
| `ESCALATE_TO_ANALYST` | Hand the case to a human analyst with the evidence | None |
| `CLOSE_NO_FRAUD` | Close the alert as legitimate | None |

An agent may recommend several actions for one case. Order them by what happens first.

### 2. Approval routing

| Route | Applies to |
|---|---|
| `auto` | `ALLOW_TRANSACTION`, `MONITOR_CARD`, `MONITOR_CONNECTED_CARDS`, `WARN_CUSTOMER`, `VERIFY_WITH_CUSTOMER`, `STEP_UP_AUTH`, `GENERATE_REPORT`, `CREATE_CASE`, `ESCALATE_TO_ANALYST`, `CLOSE_NO_FRAUD` |
| `L1` (team lead) | `DECLINE_TRANSACTION`; `BLOCK_CARD` when exposure ≤ $2,500 |
| `L2` (fraud manager) | `BLOCK_CARD` when exposure > $2,500; `BLOCK_ALL_CARDS` always; `FILE_REPORT` always |

The agent recommends. Only `auto` actions may be executed by the agent. `L1` and `L2` actions are recommended with the route stated and wait for a human.

### 3. Rules

**R1. Verify before you block on a weak signal.** If the case rests on a single signal (including a risk score alone) and your assessed fraud probability is below 0.70, recommend `VERIFY_WITH_CUSTOMER` or `STEP_UP_AUTH` before any block. Blocking a legitimate customer on one signal is a policy breach.

**R2. Customer denies the transaction.** Recommend `BLOCK_CARD` and `CREATE_CASE`. Add `FILE_REPORT` if exposure exceeds $1,000 or the case connects to a shared device profile or another card's fraud.

**R3. Customer confirms the transaction.** Recommend `CLOSE_NO_FRAUD`. Note the confirmation in the case file.

**R4. No reply within 24 hours.** Recommend `MONITOR_CARD` and `DECLINE_TRANSACTION` for pending authorizations. Escalate if exposure exceeds $500.

**R5. Card testing.** Three or more small online authorizations on one card within an hour, followed by a larger purchase: recommend `DECLINE_TRANSACTION` and `STEP_UP_AUTH`. If a purchase over $100 has already cleared, recommend `BLOCK_CARD`.

**R6. Shared origin.** When several cards show fraud from the same device profile, the same billing region, or the same recipient email in one window, name the shared element, recommend `CREATE_CASE` and `FILE_REPORT`, and `MONITOR_CONNECTED_CARDS` for every card that shares it.

**R7. Disputed but legitimate.** When the customer disputes a charge that matches their own recurring pattern (same merchant, same amount, monthly), recommend `CREATE_CASE`, `VERIFY_WITH_CUSTOMER`, and `WARN_CUSTOMER`. Do not block.

**R8. Escalate when uncertain and exposed.** If the verdict is `uncertain` and exposure exceeds $500, or the evidence conflicts, recommend `ESCALATE_TO_ANALYST`.

**R9. Undocumented patterns.** When activity fits none of the known patterns but the evidence shows coordinated or repeated abuse across customers, recommend `CREATE_CASE`, `FILE_REPORT`, and `ESCALATE_TO_ANALYST`, and describe the pattern in your own words. Do not force it into a known category.

**R10. Never `BLOCK_ALL_CARDS`** unless at least two of the customer's cards show confirmed fraud or the customer's credentials are confirmed compromised.

### 3a. A case is not a report

Two different things, and the agent produces both.

**A case** (`CREATE_CASE`) is the bank's internal record of an investigation. Open one whenever fraud probability reaches 0.30, whenever you request evidence, or whenever a customer disputes a charge. A case can be closed as fraud or as legitimate. It can be updated when new evidence arrives. It should be written into the graph so later investigations can find it: a case that names a merchant or a device becomes evidence for the next analyst.

**A suspicious activity report** (`FILE_REPORT`) is a regulatory filing sent outside the bank. File one when fraud is confirmed or strongly suspected **and** at least one of these holds: exposure exceeds $1,000; the activity connects to a shared device profile, a shared region cluster, or another customer's fraud; the pattern is coordinated or undocumented (rule R9). A report always has a case behind it. Most cases never need a report. The report narrative must stand on its own: who, what, when, where, how, and why it is suspicious.

Deciding correctly between "case only" and "case plus report" is part of the next-best-action score.

### 3b. The next best action can change

Recommend what the evidence supports now, then request more evidence if the policy calls for it, then recommend again. Example: probability 0.45 on a single signal, so the initial action is `VERIFY_WITH_CUSTOMER` under R1. The customer denies the transaction. Probability rises, and the final actions become `BLOCK_CARD`, `CREATE_CASE`, and possibly `FILE_REPORT` under R2, with connected cards placed under monitoring. Record both the initial and the final recommendation and what changed between them.

### 4. Exposure

Exposure is the sum of the absolute amounts of every transaction the agent has identified as part of the fraud episode, including the flagged one. Report it in USD.

### 5. Gathering more evidence

The agent may, without approval, ask the customer to validate a transaction, request step-up authentication, or request information from an analyst. In this round those responses are not provided. Simulate them in your own system and state the assumption you made in the case file's `evidence_requests`.

### 6. Stopping

Stop investigating when one of these holds:

- Fraud probability is at or above 0.85, or at or below 0.15, supported by at least two independent pieces of evidence
- A verification response settles the question
- Further steps are unlikely to change the decision. Say so in `stop_reason`

Investigations that continue past a defensible decision waste time. Investigations that stop before one create risk. Both are marked down.

### 7. Explaining

Every recommendation must state what evidence was used, why more evidence was requested if it was, and why the chosen actions follow from this policy. Cite the rule number.

Glossary, "Approval route":

> `auto` the agent may act alone; `L1` a team lead must approve; `L2` a fraud manager must approve

Glossary, "SAR":

> Suspicious Activity Report. The regulatory filing a bank must make for confirmed or strongly suspected fraud above certain thresholds. Part 2 of your answer, only when the policy calls for it

Answer Format, `sar.file`:

> Whether a suspicious activity report should be filed. Must agree with whether `FILE_REPORT` appears in your final actions

Answer Format, zero-out rule:

> If `file` is false: `narrative` is `""`, `subjects` is `[]`, `total_amount_usd` is 0, `activity_dates` is `[]`.

Answer Format, Notes:

> - For a `legitimate` verdict, `affected_txn_ids` is empty, `exposure_usd` is 0, and `sar.file` is false.
> - `uncertain` is a valid verdict and earns full credit on cases designed to be ambiguous, provided the actions follow policy R1 and R8.
